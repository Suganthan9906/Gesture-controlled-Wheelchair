Gesture-Controlled Wheelchair 🦽✨
This Arduino-based smart wheelchair is designed to be controlled using hand gestures, providing an innovative and accessible mobility solution. The system uses gesture sensors to detect hand movements and translates them into commands to move the wheelchair forward, backward, left, and right.

Project Overview 📌
✅ Gesture-based control for hands-free movement.
✅ Uses an accelerometer (e.g., ADXL335/ADXL345) to detect hand tilt.
✅ Controls DC motors through an H-Bridge motor driver (L298N).
✅ Buzzer alert system for safety.
✅ Can be extended with wireless control (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).

Hardware Components 🔧
1️⃣ Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega
2️⃣ Accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345)
3️⃣ Motor Driver (L298N)
4️⃣ DC Motors (for movement)
5️⃣ Battery Pack (12V recommended)
6️⃣ Buzzer (for alerts)
7️⃣ Jumper Wires & Chassis

How It Works ⚙️
1️⃣ Reads hand gestures using an accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345).
2️⃣ Maps tilt values to specific movement commands:

Tilt Forward → Move Forward
Tilt Backward → Move Backward
Tilt Left → Turn Left
Tilt Right → Turn Right
Stable Position → Stop
3️⃣ Sends commands to the motor driver (L298N) to drive DC motors.
4️⃣ Buzzer activates for safety alerts (e.g., obstacle detection, low battery, etc.).
5️⃣ Serial Monitor displays real-time gesture readings.

Gesture-Controlled Smart Wheelchair 🦽✨
This Gesture-Controlled Smart Wheelchair is an innovative mobility solution designed to help individuals with limited mobility navigate their surroundings using hand gestures. By utilizing an accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345) to detect hand movements, this system translates gestures into real-time wheelchair movement commands.

The project is built using an Arduino microcontroller, a motor driver (L298N), and DC motors to drive the wheelchair. The system offers a hands-free, intuitive control mechanism, making it highly beneficial for people with disabilities or those who struggle with traditional joystick-controlled wheelchairs.

🔹 Features & Functionalities
✅ Gesture-Based Movement: Uses an accelerometer to detect hand gestures and translate them into motion commands.
✅ Multi-Directional Control: Move forward, backward, left, right, and stop with simple tilting gestures.
✅ Motor Driver Integration: Utilizes the L298N motor driver to control the DC motors efficiently.
✅ Buzzer Alerts for Safety: A buzzer warns about potential issues like low battery or obstacles.
✅ Compact & Portable Controller: The wearable gesture sensor makes it easy to operate.
✅ Customizable Sensitivity: Can adjust movement sensitivity for better control.
✅ Scalable & Extendable: Can integrate wireless control (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi), obstacle detection, or voice commands in the future.

🔧 Components Required
Component	Description
Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega	Microcontroller for processing signals.
Accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345)	Detects hand movement and tilt.
L298N Motor Driver	Controls the movement of the DC motors.
DC Motors (12V)	Drives the wheelchair wheels.
Buzzer	Provides safety alerts.
Battery Pack (12V)	Powers the system.
Jumper Wires	Connects the components.
Chassis/Wheelchair Frame	Structure to hold all components.
🛠️ Working Principle
The system is designed to detect hand movements using an accelerometer (ADXL335/ADXL345) and process these signals through an Arduino microcontroller. The movement directions are mapped as follows:

🔼 Tilt Forward → Move Forward
🔽 Tilt Backward → Move Backward
◀️ Tilt Left → Turn Left
▶️ Tilt Right → Turn Right
⏹ Stable Position → Stop

1️⃣ The accelerometer measures tilt values along the X, Y, and Z axes.
2️⃣ The Arduino processes these values and determines movement direction.
3️⃣ The motor driver (L298N) receives signals from the Arduino and controls the DC motors accordingly.
4️⃣ If an obstacle or issue is detected, the buzzer alerts the user.
5️⃣ Serial Monitor displays real-time gesture readings and system status.

💻 Code Explanation
The program reads data from the ADXL335 accelerometer and maps the tilt values to different movement directions. The core functions include:

1️⃣ Reading Accelerometer Data:

A0 (X-axis), A1 (Y-axis), and A2 (Z-axis) values are continuously read.
These values are compared against predefined thresholds.
2️⃣ Motor Control Logic:

Depending on the tilt direction, the corresponding motor pins are activated to drive the wheelchair.
3️⃣ Buzzer Alert System:

If an obstacle or issue is detected, the buzzer activates to warn the user.
4️⃣ Serial Communication for Debugging:

The Serial Monitor displays sensor readings and movement status for debugging.
